   and after going through the approval process they can publish their livestream and screen feed which is monitored by the online proctors which are just online invigilators , based on the monitoring proctors can perform some actions like they can pause the test, terminate the test 
   and can also chat with the candidate , so basically we can say that it is an online proctoring tool to monitor the candidate throughout the exam.
