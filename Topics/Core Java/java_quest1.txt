* If we declare private method in parent class,we can also declare same name method in child class also ... but it cant override that method or u cant access that method from child classs.

* But an interface can extends any no. Of interfaces at a time hence java provides support 
for multiple inheritance through interfaces.

* At compile-time, java knows which method to call by checking the method signatures. So this is called compile-time polymorphism or static or early binding.

* If the Parent class contains any argument constructors while writing Child classes we should takes special care with respect to constructors. Whenever we are writing any argument constructor it is highly recommended to write no argument constructor also.

* A private constructor in Java is used in restricting object creation. It is a special instance constructor used in static member-only classes. If a constructor is declared as private, then its objects are only accessible from within the declared class. You cannot access its objects from outside the constructor class.
