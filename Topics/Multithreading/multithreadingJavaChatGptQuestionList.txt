The Executors class provides different thread pool implementations:

Thread Pool Type	Method	Description
Fixed Thread Pool	Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n)	‚úÖ Uses n fixed threads. Best for a consistent number of tasks.
Cached Thread Pool	Executors.newCachedThreadPool()	‚úÖ Creates new threads as needed but reuses idle threads. Best for short-lived tasks.
Single Thread Pool	Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()	‚úÖ Uses only 1 thread, executing tasks sequentially. Best for task ordering.
Scheduled Thread Pool	Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(n)	‚úÖ Executes tasks with a delay or at fixed intervals. Best for scheduled tasks.
